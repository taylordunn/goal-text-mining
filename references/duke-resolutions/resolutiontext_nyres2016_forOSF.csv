"I need to loose more weight because I am Insulin Resistant.  I had a loss of five pounds since the diagnosis in August, but need to loose more.  It was up a little after the holidays and I am on a blood-sugar regulater that also helps with weight loss but I need to do a lot more.  It has also been an up and down roller-coaster where weight is concerned due to anxiety and depression.","My boyfriend has had child support dumped on him out of the blue and we both Turk to meet the payments.  He absolutely goes into a frenzy when he thinks he isn't going to make his monthly goal which also effects me.  I need to find something, perhaps from the home since trying and trying to find something outside the home has not been good to me at all, that I can do to make our income more level so he doesn't have anything to take out on me.","I have tried and tried to get him to seek help for his emotional ups and downs and I am now thinking I need to just back off, become more so that his issues he has with child support, etc. all don't effect me when he gets like he does and allow it to as my father used to say- "" fall off of me like water off of a duck's back."" IE- Keep the calm and bounce off of me and not effect me.","I am Episcopalian and all the setbacks I have had in my life since 2010 have un-rooted, and unsettled me enough that I have been wondering where my actual vocation, or calling actually is as most everything except for Amazon Turk, and sometimes that as well- hasn't been working. Need to start working to figure that out this year.","Need to become more financially stable, although this is probably a re-statement in some ways of #2, although I hope not!  Also need to begin to clear up a credit report."
